## Hiking Routes

_Counts of routes by summit type & grade._



In total there are 544 routes from walk the highlands that hit some kind of summit. 
Each route is graded between 1 and 5. 
Below is a count of these summiting routes split between the type of summit hit and the route grade.
Note there are a bunch of routes that hit multiple summits (frequently different types). If a route hits 1 Munro and 1 Corbett it'll be included 
in the Munro count _and_ the Corbett count. If a route hits 2 Munros it'll only be counted once in the Munro count. So these numbers don't reflect the 
total number of summits, just the number of routes. Enjoy!

| *Grade:*                          | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |

## Multi Summit Routes

I've pulled out all the routes that hit more than one summit, they're sorted from easiest to hardest based on the route grade.
Within each grade they're sorted by the number of summits hit. And for the few that are still equal, the final sort is by driving time from Joppa.


| | Route Grade | Number of summits hit by type: <br />Munroes, Corbetts, Grahams, Donalds, Sub 2000s <br /> M C G D S | Walk title | Hike time | Travel time |
